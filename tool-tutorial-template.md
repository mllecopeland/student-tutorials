#Introduction#
nvALT is a fork of, or creation from, Notational Velocity. nvALT is a fast and free product that allows users to take instant notes on OSX. Notes are taken in Markdown format. This simple text form means that notes can be accessible on any platform, without restrictions. Notes in nvALT can then be found and organized using key words, and synchronized using Dropbox. It also saves your notes automatically. 

#Software & Setup
You download the application at the bottom of this webpage and can begin using it: [click here](http://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/). You can select your preferences, such as in which folder you would like to save your notes in Dropbox. You can choose if you would like the app presented horizontally or vertically, as well as add a theme and colours for the application. 

#Using the tool
As soon as the application is open you can start typing in the “title” section to quickly create a new note (with a unique name) or find an old one. nvALT is accessed through keyboard functions; the mouse is rarely required. For example, command+L is used to search or create a note and command+delete allows you to delete a note. Shift+command+T allows you to tag notes with memorable keywords to easily find them later.                      

#Conclusion
Now that you know how to install, set up, and use the application, you can explore it while researching and brainstorming an essay, or simply by creating a to-do or grocery list. It is also recommended to download the Chrome or Safari extension which allows you to transcribe text, URL, or other content in Markdown. Here is a link to the creator of nvALT, Brett Terpstra’s Tumbler: [click here](http://elasticthreads.tumblr.com/). On it he posts code, tricks, and trips for using the application. Here is an interview with Michael Schechter, from A Better Mess: [click here](http://www.macdrifter.com/2012/04/michael-schechters-writer-workflow.html). He discusses tips on how to stay organized as a writer and nvALT as one of the tools he uses. If you are interested in delving further into this application, the source code is openly available on GitHub.
